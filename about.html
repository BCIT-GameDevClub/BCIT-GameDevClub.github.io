    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to provide resources, experience, and a collaborative environment for anyone interested in game development. And, of course, to have fun doing it!</p>
    
    <h2>Club History</h2>
    <p>The BCIT Games Development Club was formed in 2011 as a space where creative people could get together and explore the medium. As students enroll and graduate, the membership and executives of the club change. As the game dev landscape and the institution evolve, so does the club. In 2016, the club held the first BCIT Game Jam, which was a rousing success. We have just undergone a change in leadership and the new execs hope to make 2016-2017 the most exciting year for the club yet.</p>
